The resolutions were <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/\">available on the UN website</a> as PDFs.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"666\" data-orig-height=\"514\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://65.media.tumblr.com/e29ca96f6a4d109d3ae8a03fcea0a3d2/tumblr_inline_o3ojawjiNw1t0f420_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"666\" data-orig-height=\"514\"/></figure><p>I&rsquo;ll skip the part where I tried using wget and tried wrestling with the UN&rsquo;s inscrutable <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/official-documents-system-search/index.html\">document search system</a> and get my rant out of the way: <i>The UN (or any similar organization) should make it easy to download their publicly available documents.</i></p><p>I reached for python using the <a href=\"https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests\">requests</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/\">BeautifulSoup</a> libraries. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"652\" data-orig-height=\"395\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/86c495667eb9cd2fa436361ab6448aa0/tumblr_inline_o3ojbiXb2K1t0f420_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"652\" data-orig-height=\"395\"/></figure><p><br/></p><pre><code>s = requests.Session()\nr = s.get(\"{}/en/sc/documents/resolutions/{}.shtml\".format(base_url, year))\nr.raise_for_status()\npage = BeautifulSoup(r.text)\nfor link in page.findAll(\"a\"):\n    # Some of the pages have relative links; some have absolute.\n    if link[\"href\"].startswith(\"/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES\"):\n        fetch_doc(\"{}{}\".format(base_url, link[\"href\"]), s)\n    elif link[\"href\"].startswith(\"http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES\"):\n        fetch_doc(link[\"href\"], s)\n</code></pre><p>Each of these links is to a frame, so that a header can be included to provide links to the document in other languages (since this is the UN after all). The HTML for the main frame is:</p><pre><code>&lt;frame src=\"http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&amp;amp;DS=S/RES/1966(2010)&amp;amp;Lang=E\" name=\"mainFrame\" title=\"PDF Document\"&gt;\n</code></pre><p>One would expect/hope that this would be a link to the PDF, but it isn&rsquo;t. </p><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body text=\"#000000\"&gt;\n&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" CONTENT=\"0; URL=/TMP/3044276.83353424.html\"&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre><p>I had to look up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh\">HTTP-EQUIV=refresh</a>, but to the best I can tell it is a bad way to do a redirect. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a form of redirect that is not handled by requests, so I had to do it myself:</p><pre><code>page = BeautifulSoup(r.text)\nlink = page.find(\"meta\", attrs={\"http-equiv\": \"refresh\"})\nurl = \"http://daccess-ods.un.org{}\".format(link[\"content\"][7:])\nr = s.get(url)\n</code></pre><p>And here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m sure I had gone down a rabbit hole, as the page returned is another frame with another HTTP-EQUIV=refresh:</p><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=windows-1252\"&gt;\n&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" CONTENT=\"1; URL=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N00/812/31/PDF/N0081231.pdf?OpenElement\"&gt;\n&lt;base target=\"_top\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;frameset ROWS=\"0,100%\" framespacing=\"0\" FrameBorder=\"0\" Border=\"0\"&gt;\n  &lt;frame name=\"footer\" scrolling=\"no\" noresize target=\"main\" src=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/prod/ods_mother.nsf?Login&amp;Username=freeods2&amp;Password=1234\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"&gt;\n  &lt;frame name=\"main\" src=\"\" scrolling=\"auto\" target=\"_top\"&gt;\n&lt;/frameset&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre><p>So fetch <code><a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N00/812/31/PDF/N0081231.pdf\">https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N00/812/31/PDF/N0081231.pdf</a></code> and get the PDF, right?  Wrong &ndash; you get an HTML page that says this:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"102\" data-orig-width=\"606\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9a37a68e3a16e0155652552035c10a9/tumblr_inline_o3ojciXLcL1t0f420_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"102\" data-orig-width=\"606\"/></figure><p>(Since this is the UN, I also received the message in French too.)</p><p>The browser successfully fetches and renders the PDF, so I knew it was possible.  I tried setting various headers (accept, accept-encoding, accept-language, user-agent) and passing back the cookies. Nothing worked. I noticed that the cookies in the script and the cookies in the browser were different, but didn&rsquo;t know what to make of this.  Here is where I admitted defeat, emailed the research assistant that it wasn&rsquo;t possible, and went to have lunch with my wife.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if was something in the Indian food or just the mental space from the problem, but that last frameset was niggling at the back of my mind.  What was the purpose of the frameset and especially the footer that called <a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/prod/ods_mother.nsf?Login&amp;Username=freeods2&amp;Password=1234?\">https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/prod/ods_mother.nsf?Login&amp;Username=freeods2&amp;Password=1234?</a> (Also, why would a username and password be available in cleartext, but I won&rsquo;t touch that one.) And why were the cookies different? And then it hit me &ndash; maybe the purpose of that footer was to set cookies. So I added a call to it, but did nothing with the result:</p><pre><code>s.get(\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/prod/ods_mother.nsf?Login&amp;Username=freeods2&amp;Password=1234\")\n</code></pre><p>This time, fetching the PDF and writing it to a file worked:</p><pre><code>r = s.get(url, headers={\"accept\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\", \"accept-encoding\": \"gzip, deflate, sdch\", \"accept-language\": \"en-US,en;q=0.8\", \"user-agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.109 Safari/537.36\", \"referer\": r.url}, stream=True)\n    r.raise_for_status()\n    print filename\n    with open(filename, 'wb') as fd:\n        for chunk in r.iter_content(2048):\n            fd.write(chunk)\n</code></pre></p>",

We had our second lesson that involved cooking traditional dishes. Today was a delicious day! We made both a savory dish and a sweet dessert.\n\nPÄƒstÄƒi: We made this first. It reminds me of a dish Chris used to make that we called \"Cottage Ham Not\" (because it was cottage ham but not at all, because it did NOT have ham in it). We prepped and cooked potatoes, green beans, and onions, flavored with fresh garlic, salt, and bay leaves.\n\nClÄƒtite: We made dessert clÄƒtite, sweet crepes with a sweet cow cheese stuffing to which we added dried blueberries. We also made a little sweet cream to put on top and grated on milk chocolate.\n\nI hope to continue these practical cooking lessons with Liuba as they are both a lot of fun as well as teach me cool skills. Liuba is a talented cook as well as teacher.</p>"

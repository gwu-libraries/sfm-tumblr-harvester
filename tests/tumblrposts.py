We had our second lesson that involved cooking traditional dishes. Today was a delicious day! We made both a savory dish and a sweet dessert.\n\nPăstăi: We made this first. It reminds me of a dish Chris used to make that we called \"Cottage Ham Not\" (because it was cottage ham but not at all, because it did NOT have ham in it). We prepped and cooked potatoes, green beans, and onions, flavored with fresh garlic, salt, and bay leaves.\n\nClătite: We made dessert clătite, sweet crepes with a sweet cow cheese stuffing to which we added dried blueberries. We also made a little sweet cream to put on top and grated on milk chocolate.\n\nI hope to continue these practical cooking lessons with Liuba as they are both a lot of fun as well as teach me cool skills. Liuba is a talented cook as well as teacher.</p>"

It reminds me of a dish Chris used to make that we called \"Cottage Ham Not\" (because it was cottage ham but not at all, because it did NOT have ham in it). We prepped and cooked potatoes, green beans, and onions, flavored with fresh garlic, salt, and bay leaves.\n\nClătite: We made dessert clătite, sweet crepes with a sweet cow cheese stuffing to which we added dried blueberries. We also made a little sweet cream to put on top and grated on milk chocolate.\n\nI hope to continue these practical cooking lessons with Liuba as they are both a lot of fun as well as teach me cool skills.
